# Attandence-app

**Version 1.4.0**

This app is to take attendance during class and is made in android studios.

It works on the Wifi feature of android devices.

It ensures that one student can only mark one attendance as the teacher's side app keeps the record
of the Ip address of the phones who are requesting to mark attendance.

This app can also be used to take attendance at various other organisations and companies.

It detects nearby devices groups and show it to user, User can then choose the group and his device
will form a Wifi connection to the host device(Teacher's device), after that user can mark his
attendance by clicking on the absent button and entering his attendance when asked.

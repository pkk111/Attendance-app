# Attandence-app

**Version 1.4.0**

This app is to take attendance during class and is made in android studios.

It ensures that one student can only mark one attendance as the teacher's side app keeps the record of the ip address of the phones who are requesting to mark attendance.

This app can also be used to take attendance at various other organisations and companies.

It detects nearby devices groups and show it to user, User can then choose the group and his device will form a Wifi connection to the host device(Teacher's device),
after that user can mark his attendance by clicking on the absent button and entering his attendance when asked.
